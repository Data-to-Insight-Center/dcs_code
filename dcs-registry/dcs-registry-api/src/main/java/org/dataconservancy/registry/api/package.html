Data Conservancy Registry Framework API

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
    The design goal of the Data Conservancy Registry Framework is to provide a generic approach for creating, managing,
    and querying registries within a Data Conservancy instance.  Currently the Framework supplies implementations
    supporting query operations, but registry creation and management interfaces are not defined or implemented.</p>
<p>
    For the purposes of this Framework, a Registry is considered to be a bucket of identifiable objects that serve a
    common purpose or domain of interest.  This Framework explicitly designs and accounts for the existence of multiple
    Registries that service different domains.  For example, an instance of the Data Conservancy may have a
    Format Registry, a Data License Registry, and a Transformation Registry, just to name a few.</p>
<p>
    Each {@link org.dataconservancy.registry.api.Registry Registry} provides access to domain objects by their
    identifier, or by enumerating the contents of the registry using a subset of the Java Collections Framework
    <code>Map</code> API.  {@link org.dataconservancy.registry.api.support.RegistryEntry Entries} in the <code>Registry</code>
    wrap domain objects, and provide access to the entry's identifier, and human-readable name.</p>
