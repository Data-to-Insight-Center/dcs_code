Provides supporting classes of the Data Conservancy Registry Framework API

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
    These interfaces are likely to be used by {@link org.dataconservancy.registry.api.Registry Registry}
    implementations. The model mapper interfaces provide mechanisms for converting between a domain object and packaging
    formats (currently the <a href="https://scm.dataconservancy.org/confluence/x/gQBE">Data Conservancy Packaging</a>
    is supported). The {@link org.dataconservancy.registry.api.support.RegistryEntry} is an abstraction over domain
    objects, allowing model mapping interfaces to work generically with domain objects.
