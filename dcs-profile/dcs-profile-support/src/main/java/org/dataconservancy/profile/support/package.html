Provides utility classes for examining a Data Conservancy Package, and determining whether
or not the package conforms to a profile.


<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
    {@link org.dataconservancy.registry.profile.support.ProfileStatement ProfileStatement}s are the
    foundation of a profile.  A statement consists of a String and a {@link org.dataconservancy.registry.profile.support.MatchOp match operator}.
    Statements are then evaluated against candidate Strings using the supplied comparison operator.
</p>

<p>
    A single statement can be evaluated against a single string, or against a collection of strings.  If the
    statement is being evaluated against a collection of strings, a {@link org.dataconservancy.registry.profile.support.CollectionMatchStrategy matching strategy}
    must be provided.  The strategy is used to determine how many, if any, candidate strings in the collection must be matched.
</p>

<p>
    Note that the Feature Extraction Framework has done some {@link org.dataconservancy.transform.profile work} with
    profiles.  It may be instructive and/or practical to reconcile these two approaches in the future.
</p>

<h2>Example Usage</h2>
<p>
<pre>
    public class LicenceRegistryEntryProfile {

        private ProfileStatement duType;       // injected
        private Set&lt;ProfileStatement> techEnv; // injected

        public boolean conforms(Dcp package) {

            DcsDeliverableUnit du = ...;  // extracted from package

            if (!duType.evaluate(du.getType())) {
                log.debug("Deliverable Unit does not conform to a license registry entry");
                return false;
            }

            ...

            boolean conforms = true;

            for (DcsManifestation candidateManifestation : du.getManifestations()) {
                for (ProfileStatement statement : techEnv) {
                    conforms &= statement.evaluate(candidateManifestation.getTechicalEnvironment(),
                                    CollectionMatchStrategy.AT_LEAST_ONE);
                }
                if (conforms) return;
            }

            ...

            return conforms;
        }
    }
