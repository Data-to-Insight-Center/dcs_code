Data Conservancy Registry Framework API

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
    The design goal of the Data Conservancy Registry Framework is to provide a generic approach for creating, managing,
    and querying registries within a Data Conservancy instance.  Currently the Framework supplies implementations
    supporting query operations, but registry creation and management interfaces are not defined or implemented.</p>
<p>
    For the purposes of this Framework, a Registry is considered to be a bucket of identifiable objects that serve a
    common purpose or domain of interest.  This Framework explicitly designs and accounts for the existence of multiple
    Registries that service different domains.  For example, an instance of the Data Conservancy may have a
    Format Registry, a Data License Registry, and a Transformation Registry, just to name a few.</p>
<p>
    Each {@link org.dataconservancy.registry.api.Registry Registry} provides access to domain objects by their
    identifier, or by searching for entries by a key.
    {@link org.dataconservancy.registry.api.RegistryEntry RegistryEntries} in the <code>Registry</code>
    wrap domain objects, and provide access to the properties common to all entries. The {@code RegistryEntry} is an
    abstraction over domain objects, allowing clients to work generically with entries.</p>
<p>
    Registry entries carry <em>identifiers</em> and <em>keys</em>.  This framework defines <em>identifiers</em> as being
    opaque, immutable, globally unique strings.  A registry entry identifier is guaranteed to resolve to zero or one
    entry. Therefore, if one instance of the Data Conservancy has a registry entry identified as "entry/1" and another
    instance of the Data Conservancy has a registry entry identified as "entry/1", then those entries <em>must be</em>
    identical.</p>
<p>
    <em>Keys</em> are non-opaque, mutable, and are not guaranteed to be globally unique.  Lookup of entries by key may
    return zero or more entries.  For example, the key "application/xml" could be used to query a transformation
    registry or a format registry, or both at once.  A lookup for "application/xml" against two different Data
    Conservancy instances may return different sets of entries.
